Soukie Modern approached me in mid-2022 regarding their need to modernize their existing online shop, as they were looking to start leveraging e-commerce to show potential buyers their expansive collection of vintage and contemporary Moroccan rugs.

After some time getting to know the company and the founder, Taib Lotfi, I set out to design a website as expressive and beautiful as their offerings.

Given the large format and level of detail of the rugs, having large product images front-and-center was definitely at top of mind throughout the design process. We wanted potential buyers to see each rug in as much detail as possible.

To develop the website, I settled on using Next.js Commerce, an amazing solution that offers a fantastic starting point for e-commerce sites. Given that Soukie had their products on Shopify, it was just a matter of configuring the `shopify` package to fit the needs of a retailer with hundreds of product offerings and building a gorgeous web interface around that.
